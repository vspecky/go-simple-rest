# Simple Golang REST API
A simple REST API I made following a tutorial to aid in my endeavor to learn Golang. Tutorial can be found [here](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/creating-restful-api-with-golang/)  
<br>
I tried to add my own stuff and mods. For example, I commented the code everywhere, I implemented the updating articles function, I did error handling and used correct HTTP status codes to inform the client about errors.

Made using the gorilla/mux package
